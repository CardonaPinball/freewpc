<h1>FreeWPC - New Software for Your '90s Bally/Williams Pinball</h1>

<h2>What is FreeWPC?</h2>

<p><b>FreeWPC</b> is a free platform for developing replacement game ROMs for
Bally/Williams pinball machines based on the WPC (Williams Pinball Controller)
chip.  FreeWPC provides the foundation for building new ROMs with custom game
rules.

<p>FreeWPC only replaces your game ROM (the U6 chip), which contains all
of the game code and dot matrix text/graphics.  In particular, sounds and
music are NOT included in this chip, so you'll have to get by with
reusing the same sounds/music as are provided normally.  This
project is ambitious enough; perhaps others could work on replacement
audio?

<p>Some important features of FreeWPC:

<ul>
<li>It is 100% Williams-free code, written from scratch.
<li>Code is written mostly in C, thanks to the availability of a halfway
decent C compiler for the 6809 CPU.  In some places, assembly language
code is used for performance or to do some really low-level things.
Using C over assembler should allow more people to get involved with the
project.
<li>Development can be done under Linux or under Windows using the
Cygwin UNIX emulation suite.
<li>The system is designed to be flexible and extensive.  Eventually,
all generations of WPC should be supported, and multiple machines can
be targeted using the same common core code.
<li>Eventually, code should be able to run on an actual pinball machine;
however, for now, FreeWPC ROMs should only be used in emulators such as
Visual PinMame.  <b>Repeat: do not attempt to put a FreeWPC ROM in a 
real machine!</b> I guarantee you, it won't work and you may cause 
irreparable damage to your game, yourself, your house, etc... 
You have been warned.
</ul>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>

<h2>Downloads</h2>

<p>The initial target machine is <b>Twilight Zone</b>.  Preview Releases
are being provided in binary format for those who would like to play
around with these ROMs under PinMame or Visual Pinball.

<p><a href="NOTREADY">Download Preview Release 1</a>.

<p>Source code for the entire development platform will not be
publicly released yet, until things are more stable.

<h2>Installation (PinMAME or Visual PinMAME)</h2>

<p>You will need to copy the ROM file into your PinMAME <b>roms</b>
directory so that PinMAME can find it.  The location of this directory
depends on how you installed PinMAME.  Make sure to save your original
version of the ROM file for when you want to revert back.

<h2>Internal Design</h2>

<p>I've written a short paper on 
<a href="freewpc_design.html">the design of FreeWPC</a>.
New developers should definitely take a look at this before getting
involved.  It covers some basic embedded systems concepts as well
as describing how some of the features are implemented.  It also explains
some of the inner workings of the WPC chip, as that is the key to
understanding how all of the I/O works.

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>

The current Preview Releases lack a lot of things; they are intended to
demonstrate only the most basic functionality.  Here are some of the
areas that need addressing:

<ul>
<li>General illumination is not implemented yet.
<li>Dot matrix transitional effects are non-existent.
<li>Built-in support for distributing code throughout the ROM is not
yet ready (but I'm working on it!)  The code is limited to 48K in size
today.
<li>Only one font is implemented, and it's rather ugly.  Plus there are
no graphics.  Anyone with experience and interest to work on that should
let me know.
<li>The code has not been thoroughly optimized.  I've tried to address
grotesque wasteful uses of CPU and memory, but there is much to be done
in this area.  The compiler is, sadly, not the greatest.
</ul>

<h2>Want to Help?</h2>

<p>If you are interested in working on this project, please contact me
at <a href="mailto:freewpc@oddchange.com">freewpc@oddchange.com</a>.  
Developers should be familiar
with basic embedded systems programming concepts and the C programming
language.  Familiarity with 6809 assembler is <i>highly</i> recommended.
Also, knowledge of WPC pinball machines is expected, but I'm assuming
anyone interested would probably meet that requirement.

<p>All development is currently done under the Linux operating system.
I use <a href="subversion">Subversion</a> for source control.
