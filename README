This is FreeWPC, an open source operating system for the Williams
Pinball Controller (WPC) family of pinball machines.

The sources for the common routines are located in 'kernel', while
the game-specific code can be found in a subdirectory based on the
machine name.

Also included is a patch for gcc for building a 6809 cross compiler,
based on earlier works but modified significantly; and sources for
a small libc taken mostly as-is from similar work done for the CoCo
computer series.

You will need several other tools in order to make final ROM images.
The venerable Unix 'dd' utility is used to pad files to the correct
size.  A tool called 'srec_cat' is used to convert from S-records into
binary.
