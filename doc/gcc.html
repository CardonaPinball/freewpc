<h1>GCC for the 6809 Processor</h1>

<p><b>FreeWPC</b> uses a port of the GNU C Compiler (gcc) to the 6809.
This port is not officially part of gcc, and exists "out of tree".
However, I have found that it works pretty well, after making some
modifications to it.

<p>This documentation describes some of the limitations of the C
compiler, how you should be careful when coding performance critical
routines, and some of the changes that I made to it specifically for
this project, which may or may not be of use to others.
