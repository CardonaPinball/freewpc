<p>FreeWPC uses <b>Subversion</b>, a source control tool similar to
<b>cvs</b>.  The Subversion repository is available for anonymous
read access.  Developers who wish to deliver changes to the
main project can send email to <i>freewpc@oddchange.com</i> and ask
for an account in order to get commit privileges.</p>

<h2>Checking Out the Repository</h2>

<p>When getting started, you will need to checkout a copy of the latest
codebase into a new directory.  Create a directory called freewpc first,
and switch into that:

<pre>
mkdir freewpc
cd freewpc
</pre>

<p>Then to checkout the code from the server,

<pre>
svn checkout http://www.oddchange.com/svn/public/freewpc/trunk</b>
</pre>

<p>This will create a directory called <b>trunk</b> and populate it
with the latest files in the repository.

<h2>Updating Your Working Copy</h2>

<p>You can just do <b>svn update</b>, either at the root or in any
subdirectory, to grab the latest versions of all the files.  Most all
Subversion commands work this way.  You can also give a single filename,
and it will only apply to that one file instead of the whole directory.

<pre>
svn update
</pre>

<h2>Checking In Changes</h2>

<p>Use the <b>commit</b> command to push your local changes back to the project
server.  You must have write privileges in order to perform this command.</p>
<pre>
svn commit
</pre>

<h2>Checking the Status of All Files</h2>

<p>Use the <b>status</b> command to get a summary of the status of each
file and directory:

<pre>
svn status
</pre>

<p>The one-letter prefix in front of each file tells you the status:
<b>M</b>=modified, <b>?</b>=not in source control, <b>C</b>=in conflict!
