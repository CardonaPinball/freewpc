Use inheritance in switch drivers to set all fields correctly for
	various kinds of switches
Rudimentary animations by panning over a static image larger than the
	display
Add image compression/decompression algorithms
Do proper switch debouncing/queueing
Better DMD function names (low? used everywhere)


Display Effects
---------------
Currently there are only two types of effects: normal and "running".  Running
deffs are queued up and will continue to compete for the display until
explicitly stopped.  Normal deffs will give up if they don't have enough
priority to start.

This works OK except for when lots of deffs try to compete for the display
at once.  Then only the highest priority at any time wins.

Consider adding "retry" capability to a deff so that if doesn't get the DMD,
it can wait for some time (a running deff then is defined to have infinite
retry).  When a ball is in a lockup device, this is a good time to "catch up"
and give all of the deffs a shot.

Consider alternating display effects when they have equal priority.
