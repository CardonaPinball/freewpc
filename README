The sources for the common routines are located in 'kernel', while
the game-specific code can be found in a subdirectory based on the
machine name.

You will need several other tools in order to make final ROM images.
See the file doc/build.html for more detailed information.  Most
importantly, you'll need a copy of the gcc6809 cross-compiler.
