<h1>Overview of the FreeWPC Build Procedure</h1>

In order to build a FreeWPC ROM from scratch, the following steps
are taken by the Makefile:

<ol>
<li>Determine the configuration.  At a minimum, you must specify a value
for <b>MACHINE</b>, which determines the target machine.  The value of
MACHINE is cached by creating symbolic links into the target source/include
directories, so this only really needs to be specified when changing targets.
MACHINE can be specified on the command-line; another way is to assign in
a file called <b>user.mak</b> in the current directory/your home directory.
<li>Autogenerate defines.  Certain #defines are automatically set for you
by scanning the source code to find all uses.
<li>Compile the source code.
<li>Generate callsets and compile the generated code.
<li>Build an executable ROM image.  This involves linking all of the object
files together correctly, building each paged section, and then combining
them all together into one ROM file.  Unused sections of ROM are padded with
blanks (0xFF).
</ol>

<h2>Other Configuration Options</h2>

<p>Like MACHINE, these are most easily set by using a user.mak file.</p>
